# CS545-WatchMyNutrition
This is a class project for CS545. 
This is a web based application to manage an individual’s daily nutrition intake based on their age, height, weight, vital signs and lifestyle. The application will provide food suggestions per week or per day basis based on the food consumed in recent past. The app’s motive is to ensure the person has a balanced diet. The user can select one of the suggestions and based on this the app can provide a link to a food delivery app that can deliver the suggested dish from a nearby restaurant or a list of ingredients to purchase from a store to make the dish.

User Story:
Alice is a graduate student who has a busy schedule with her course work and job hunt. She finds it difficult to manage her time between studies and personal life. She doesn’t have enough time to concentrate on her food habits and the amount of nutrients/ calories intake she’s supposed to have in a day to keep herself physically and mentally active. She is worried that this will impact her health in the long run.

Alice found out that “WatchMyNutrition” website helps the users with information about food they should consume in a day based on the user’s biometrics including age, height, weight etc., As Alice was not able to keep track of her daily calorie/nutrient intake which in turn is impacting her course work, she decided to give this website a try. 

When she logged into the app, it asked her about the physical characteristics like age, gender, height, weight. Once she completed all the required fields, the application started predicting the calorie, nutrients intake for a day and giving her suggestions regarding the type of food she can have for breakfast, lunch and dinner to maintain a healthy and active life. 

She had a burger as brunch and she’s unhappy about it. She logs into the app and provides the details of her breakfast. Based on these details, the app provides her a list of possible lunch options. She can choose one of these based on her interest for the day. Once she selects one of these options, the app provides her the capability to either order this dish in or find the groceries to cook it herself. She orders the dish to her apartment and closes the app happily.
